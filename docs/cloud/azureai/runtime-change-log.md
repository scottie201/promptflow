# Change log of default runtime image
## Runtime image
In Azure Machine Learning prompt flow, runtime provides the environment to execute flows. The default runtime includes a pre-built Docker image, which contains all necessary dependent packages.

### Pull image
The image can be pulled by specifying a runtime version and executing the following command:
```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/promptflow/promptflow-runtime-stable:<runtime_version>
```

### Check image version
You can check the runtime image version from the flow execution log:
